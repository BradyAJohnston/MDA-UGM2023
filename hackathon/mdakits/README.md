# Build an MDAKit

[MDAKits](https://mdakits.mdanalysis.org/) are
standalone packages containing code using MDAnalysis components that
solves a specific scientific problems or in some form enhances the
functionality of MDAnalysis core library. An MDAKit can be written by
anyone and hosted anywhere.

## About MDAKits...

A MDAKit can be registered in the [MDAKits
registry](https://mdakits.mdanalysis.org/mdakits.html) and ar thus be
advertised to the whole MDAnalysis community. They will also be
continuously tested against the latest released version and the
current development version of the core MDAnalysis library so that
users and developers have an up-to-date view of the code health of an
MDAKit.
