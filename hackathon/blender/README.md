# MDAnalysis and Blender

The [Molecular
Nodes](https://bradyajohnston.github.io/MolecularNodes/) plugin (by
@BradyAJohnston) for the 3D animation and rendering program
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) makes it possible to do highly
professional renderings of MD trajectories. Under the hood, *Molecular
Nodes* uses MDAnalysis for trajectory I/O.
